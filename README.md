Shannon Fano Algorithm is an entropy encoding technique for lossless data compression of multimedia. Named after Claude Shannon and Robert Fano, it assigns a code to each symbol based on their probabilities of occurrence. It is a variable-length encoding scheme, that is, the codes assigned to the symbols will be of varying length(you need to change file path)
